Below I have provided an analysis of the rideshare data showing the differences amoung the different city types.

- Total Rides for Each City Type

Based off of the data above we can see that the total rides occur in the Urban area. In which is almost three times as more rides than the Suburban area.

- Total Drivers for Each City Type

We can see here that the Urban area has more drivers than Surburban and Rural areas.

- Total Fares

The total amount paid for fares is in the Urban area with the Rural area being the lowest for total fares.

- Average fare per ride and driver

From this data I conclude that when the ride sharing services are used in the Rural area the commute is longer in which is the reason for the high average fare per ride.

The Rural area is the highest for avg fare per driver. Even with the lowest amount of drivers at 78 they are paying more for fares.

- Total fare by city type

Looking closely at all of the data from the cities the Urban area is paying almost two times more in total fares than the other cities. I think this is due to people in the Urban area going with the cheapest option and not being able to afford another ride share option. They also may take more frequent short trips in which would cause the total fares number to be increasingly higher than other areas.

The plot below will give you a better glimpse of the total fare by city type and the fares for all cities. We see that the Urban area utitlizes ride sharing services more than the Rural and Suburban areas.

# Summary

1. I would recommend looking further into what is causing the low driver fares in Urban areas. Could it be they are taking shorter trips so the fare itâ€™s lower.  It looks as if the area is overpopulated with drivers unlike the Rural and Suburban areas.  I would increase the drivers in the Rural area to be sure the demand is being met for this service. 

2. I would put all of the drivers in one pool  in order for them to increase profit. This will even the total drivers across the board. Or assign drivers to a different city every shift to make it fair for them to make an equal amount of money.

3. For the Rural area the demand does not seem high for the ride sharing services so possibly market ride sharing services more to this area or run a possible promotion to gain new customers in this area.
